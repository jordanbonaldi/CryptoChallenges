So imagine what it would be like if recipes were packaged inside black
boxes. You couldn't see what ingredients they're using, let alone change
them, and imagine if you made a copy for a friend, they would call you
a pirate and try to put you in prison for years. That world would create
tremendous outrage from all the people who are used to sharing recipes.
But that is exactly what the world of proprietary software is like. A
world in which common decency towards other people is prohibited or
prevented.
